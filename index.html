      <p><b>The Human League and Heaven 17 founding member Martyn Ware is one of three British artists who have come together to create an immersive multimedia exhibition celebrating the unique beauty of the UK steel industry.</b></p>
      <p>Martyn, 61, Tracey Moberly, 53, and Sarah Hopkins, 45, will be displaying their collaborative efforts at the two-week-long POWER exhibition, launched last night (29 March) at Trafalgar Warehouse.</p>
      <p>The steel-inspired exhibition is designed to appeal to the senses with a range of works including photography, screen prints, textile banners, 3D soundscapes, projections and even a dance performance at the launch.</p>
      <p>The artists all have family backgrounds in the steel working hubs of Sheffield and Port Talbot and they have all found creative inspiration in the landscapes, machinery and people that power the industry.</p>

      <p>It was through his father’s 50 years of work as a toolmaker in Sheffield’s steel works, that Martyn realised he wanted no part in the steel industry himself.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was horrible, filthy, insanely difficult work. It created enormous health problems; some people died, some people were injured, a lot of people got chronic illnesses through the inhalation of steel dust. I’m sure that contributed to my father’s ill health later in life.”</p>
      <p>But it was Martyn’s respect for his father’s profession that inspired his contribution to the POWER exhibition.</p>
      <p>“I feel a great deal of empathy for the people who had to work in the steel industry because there was very little work around when my father was growing up. His dream was to work in an office in Sheffield.
      That was a big deal. It just so happened that he started his career right in the middle of the Great Depression, so he had to go into steel working.”</p>
      <p>He added: “There were no recruitment agencies back then, not even a labour exchange. You just heard on the grapevine when jobs were available and those were the jobs you had to take at a time of mass unemployment. My father was one of many very brave, noble people who just had to provide for their families.”</p>
      <p>After his success in the music industry, multimedia whizz Martyn founded Illustrious in 2000, a company that specialises in creating 3D soundscapes and installations for major museums, theatres and live events.</p>
      <p>Though Martyn met Tracey and Sarah through their art, it was their shared backgrounds in steel that led to a collaboration of his passion for sound and video, Sarah’s printmaking and Tracey’s work with textile banners.</p>

      <section class="content">

      <p>Born in Port Talbot and based in Swansea, Sarah had always based her prints on the steel industry as both her parents worked at the Port Talbot steel works.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve been brought up with it. Where I used to live, I could look out at the steel works from my bedroom window and I’ve visited at various times throughout my life. But when I went with Martyn and Tracey most recently, I saw it from a completely different perspective instead of as a visiting family member.</p>
      <p>“We went into the boss plant which I had only ever heard of from my father. The scale of the machinery and the heat coming off it was just unbelievable. My father used to work in a place not far from there and it was really good to see everything he used to talk so passionately about.”</p>
      <p>But it isn’t just Sarah’s family connection to the steel works that inspires her artwork.</p>
      <p>She said: “I find it more interesting to celebrate cityscapes and industry than make images from things that are already beautiful. I can’t do anything with that. It gives me much more satisfaction to create art from the ugly side of the place where I grew up.”</p>
      <p>Like Sarah, Tracey also found inspiration in her family ties to steel and the industrial aesthetic.</p>
      <p>She said: “When I was staying part time in Swansea I would pass Port Talbot steel works several times a week. My father was part of a team that had built the extension on the steel works and I would think of his sweat and toil still existing within the bricks and mortar and of the generations of people just like him.</p>
      <p>“I love the beauty of both industrial and post-industrial landscapes and started Instagramming the smoking burning scenes of Port Talbot. I decided I wanted to work towards something bigger to celebrate this.”</p>
      <p>Growing up in South Wales, Tracey noticed the decline of the “age of industry and manufacture” that was booming when she was born.</p>
      <p>The steel industry was not exempt from this, with its workforce and production output still steadily decreasing today:</p>

      <p>As for the next step, the trio already have plans to continue celebrating the beauty and legacy of this declining industry with an exhibit in Llanelli, South Wales in May.</p>
      <p>As this will be a contemporary theatre space instead of an ex-industrial building, there will be more scope for displaying in the foyer, projecting onto the outside of the building and a longer stage version of the dance from the Sheffield launch.</p>
      <p>A disused power plant in Iceland has also invited the team to come and do an exhibit and there have even been discussions about capturing the smell of the steel industry in bespoke fragrances for both Sheffield and Port Talbot.</p>
      <p>Martyn said: “Every iteration of the show will be different and we hope to develop it with new content continuously. We'd like to take it, and we are going to take it, international.”</p>
